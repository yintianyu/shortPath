# shortPath

Implemented a Dijkstra algorithm in Haskell.

I have added detailed comment in Chinese.

## You should know

This project uses IntelliJ IDEA with the plugin IntelliJ-Haskell, along with the Haskell management tool Stack.

Please visit https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/ to learn how to establish a stack project.

## Usage
There is a demo graph in "./graph/railway.txt".

You can construct your own graph like that.

In "./app/Main.hs", modify the graph input file path and the start and destination node.

Just have fun
